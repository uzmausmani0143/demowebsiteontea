    <p style="color:black;padding:20px;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea" target="_blank">Tea</a> is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis, an evergreen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub" target="_blank">shrub</a> native to East Asia which probably originated in the borderlands of southwestern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" target="_blank">China</a> and northern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar" target="_blank">Myanmar</a>.Tea is also rarely made from the leaves of <i>Camellia taliensis</i>.After plain water, tea is the most widely consumed drink in the world.There are many different types of tea; some have a <strong>cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour,while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes</strong>. Tea has a stimulating effect in humans primarily due to its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine" target="_blank">caffeine</a> content.</p>

	<p style="color:black;padding:20px;">An early credible record of tea drinking dates to the third century AD, in a medical text written by Chinese physician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Tuo" target="_blank">Hua Tuo<a>.[12] It was popularised as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking subsequently spread to other East Asian countries. Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to Europe during the 16th century.During the 17th century, drinking tea became fashionable among the English, who started to plant tea on a large scale in British India.</p>

	
	<h2><ins><center>Botanical origin</ins></h2>
	<div style="color:black;padding:20px;"><p> According to legend, tea has been known in China since about 2700 BCE.Tea plants are native to East Asia and probably originated in the borderlands of southwestern <a href="">China and northern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar" target="_blank">Myanmar</a>.</p> </div>
	
	<h2><ins><center>Chemical composition</ins></h2>
	<div style="color:black;padding:20px;"><p>
	<a href="ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine" target="_blank">Caffeine</a> constitutes about 3% of tea's dry weight, translating to between 30 and 90 milligrams per 250-millilitre (8+1⁄2 US fl oz) cup depending on the type, brand,[54] and brewing method.[55] A study found that the caffeine content of one gram of black tea ranged from 22 to 28 mg, while the caffeine content of one gram of green tea ranged from 11 to 20 mg, reflecting a significant difference.Tea also contains small amounts of theobromine and theophylline, which are stimulants, and xanthines similar to caffeine</p></div>
	
	<h2><ins><center>Health effects</ins></h2>
	<div style="color:black;padding:20px;"><p>
	<ul><li><b>Less inflammation and oxidation</b>-Green tea contains polyphenols, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</li>
	<li><b>Increased alertness and focus</b>-Green tea scores more points with these brain-boosting gains.</li>
	<li><b>Improved sleep and relaxation</b>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamomile" target="_blank">Chamomile</a> tea can provide these benefits.</li>
	<li><b>Better hydration</b>-“Drinking tea is a great way to stay hydrated and can help to break up the monotony of just drinking water,”.</li>
	<li><b>Lower blood pressure and cholesterol</b>-Florek said it’s possible that rooibos tea can improve these heart disease risk factors.</li>
	<li><b>Soothing an upset stomach</b>-Mint tea can help alleviate nausea and stomachaches.</li>
	<li><b>Lower odds of diabetes and heart disease</b>-People who drink tea tend to have less risk of developing these conditions,But it’s not clear if tea should get the credit for these benefits.It is unclear if it’s the compounds in tea that cause lower risk or that tea drinkers tend to have healthier lifestyles overall.</li></p></div>
	<h2><ins><center>Production</center></ins></h2>
	<div style="color:black;padding:20px;"><p>Tea is mainly grown in Asia and Africa, though it is also grown in South America and around the Black and Caspian Seas. The four biggest tea-producing countries are China, India, Kenya and Sri Lanka, together representing 75% of world tea production. Smaller hubs of production include such places as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Miguel_Island" target="_blank">São Miguel Island</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azores" target="_blank">Azores</a>, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal" target="_blank">Portugal</a>, and Guria, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia" target="_blank">Georgia</a>. In 2020, global production of tea was 7.0 million tonnes, led by China with 42% and India with 20% of the world total. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya" target="_blank">Kenya</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" target="_blank">Argentina</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" target="_blank">Sri Lanka</a> were secondary producers.</p></div>
