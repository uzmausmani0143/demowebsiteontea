	<p>Only black tea goes through all stages of the manufacturing process. Green tea and oolong acquire their qualities through variations in the crucial fermentation stage.</p>

	<dd>Plucking the leaf initiates the withering stage, in which the leaf becomes flaccid and loses water until, from a fresh moisture content of <strong>70 to 80 percent</strong> by weight, it arrives at a withered content of <strong>55 to 70 percent</strong>, depending upon the type of processing.</dd>
	<li><dt><font color="forestgreen">Rolling</font></dt></li>
	<dd>At this stage, the withered leaf is distorted, acquiring the distinctive twist of the finished tea leaf, and leaf cells are burst, resulting in the mixing of <a href="">enzymes</a> with polyphenols.</dd>
	<li><dt><font color="forestgreen">Fermentation</font></dt></li>
	<dd>Fermentation commences when leaf cells are broken during rolling and continues when the rolled leaf is spread on tables or perforated aluminum trays under controlled conditions of temperature, humidity, and aeration. The process actually is not fermentation at all but a series of chemical reactions.</dd>
	<li><dt><font color="forestgreen">Drying</font></dt></li>
	<dd>At this stage, heat inactivates the polyphenol enzymes and dries the leaf to a moisture content of about 3 percent. It also caramelizes sugars, thereby adding flavours to the finished product, and imparts the black colour associated with fermented tea.</dd>
	<li><dt><font color="forestgreen">packaging-Sorting and grading</font></dt></li>
	<dd>The first step in packaging tea is grading it by particle size, shape, and cleanliness. This is carried out on mechanical sieves or sifters fitted with meshes of appropriate size. With small-sized teas in demand, some processed teas are broken or cut again at this stage to get a higher proportion of broken grades. Undesirable particles, such as pieces of tough stalk and fibre, are removed by hand or by mechanical extractor. Winnowing by air removes dust, fibres, and fluff.</dd>
	<li><dt><font color="forestgreen">Packing</font></dt></li>
	<dd>Teas are packed in airtight containers in order to prevent absorption of moisture, which is the principal cause of loss of flavour during storage. Packing chests are usually constructed of plywood, lined with aluminum foil and paper, and sealed with the same material. Also used are corrugated cardboard boxes lined with aluminum foil and paper or paper sacks lined with plastic.</dd>
